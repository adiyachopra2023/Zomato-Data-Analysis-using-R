# Zomato-Data-Analysis-using-R
## Introduction
The basic idea of analysing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places all over the world, aggregate rating of each restaurant. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. In Spite of increasing demand, it has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serve the same food. Most of the people are dependent mainly on restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand for restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. 
This kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as 
• Location of the restaurant 
• Approx. Price of food 
• Restaurants and their quality of food as per public rating
• Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants 
• Is a particular neighbourhood famous for its own kind of food.

## Problem Statement
Problems identified:-
1.	 Identifying the various strategies adopted by various restaurants is a hectic task.
2.	Analysing how Zomato is different from its competitors .
3.	Analysing the perfect location and perfect cuisines for restaurants to open at certain places.
4.	Analysing which food is famous in which places
5.	Analysing relationships between restaurants, food and ratings
To make it easier for the user to understand, all of these issues need to be resolved through proper visualisation.
